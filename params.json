{"name":"Snabb","tagline":"Micro framework para php","body":"# What is this?\r\nIs a compilation about snippets that I found over internet and put them together to work as a micro framework for PHP.\r\n\r\n# How to use it?\r\n\r\nFirst you download, fork or clone the repository. And add a couple of files to have your site running.\r\n\r\nHere is how you can use it:\r\n## Routes\r\n\r\nThis modules is from a github repo ([php-rails-routing](https://github.com/infostreams/php-rails-routing)). I made some modifications. In order to resolve controller Class, action (instance method) and view.\r\n\r\n### Defining routes\r\n\r\nGo to folder `config` and open `routes.php` \r\n\r\nand add your routes as follow:\r\n\r\n`// mapping for http://<location>/hello/`\r\n`$r->map(\"/hello\", \"hello::world\");`\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n\r\n * \"/hello\" is a route on your site\r\n * \"hello::world\" is a mixed term controller::action\r\n\r\nso router will runs \r\n\r\n`// ->  HelloController->worldAction()`\r\n\r\n### Defining controllers\r\n\r\nIn the `app/controllers` folder you put the controllers to handle your routes\r\n\r\nthe convention name is <ControllerName>Controller.php\r\n\r\ncontrollers are clases like follow:\r\n\r\n`<?php`\r\n`class HelloController {`\r\n\r\n  `//Action related to route`\r\n  `public function worldAction() {`\r\n     `return [ \"title\" => \"Hello World!\" ] ;`\r\n  `}`\r\n\r\n`}`\r\n`?>`\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
